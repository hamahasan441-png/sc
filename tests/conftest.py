"""Pytest configuration — ensures the project root is on sys.path.

Test-suite authorization model
------------------------------
The framework gates destructive post-exploitation behind an explicit
operator acknowledgment (``--authorized`` on the CLI or
``ATOMIC_AUTHORIZED=1`` in the environment — see core/authorization.py).
The test suite exercises scanner and exploit *behavior*, so the whole
suite runs as an acknowledged operator environment by default.

Tests that verify the gate itself must temporarily remove the variable
(e.g. with ``mock.patch.dict(os.environ, ...)`` after deleting the key);
see ``tests/test_authorization_gate.py``.
