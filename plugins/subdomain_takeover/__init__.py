"""
Subdomain Takeover Detection Plugin for ATOMIC Framework

Detects dangling DNS records that could allow subdomain takeover attacks.
Checks CNAME records against known vulnerable service fingerprints.

Usage:
    Drop this folder into the ``plugins/`` directory and the PluginManager
    will auto-discover it on the next scan.
